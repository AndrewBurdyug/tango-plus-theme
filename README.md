tango-plus-theme
================

Color theme for Emacs loosely based on the tango palette.  As all
themes, this is a work in progress.  The basis for this theme was the
tango theme that is part of Emacs 24.  However, some colors where
added to increase contrast.  Also, support was added for evil, org
mode, mu4e, and helm.

## Installation

Have Emacs 24 or higher.  Put the file tango-plus-theme.el in a
directory included in your load-path.  Add the following line to your
startup file (typically init.el):

    (load-theme 'tango-plus t)
